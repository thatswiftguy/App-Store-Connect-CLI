## Scripting Tips

- Output defaults are TTY-aware: interactive terminals default to `table`, while piped/non-interactive output defaults to minified `json`.
- Use `--output table` or `--output markdown` for explicit human-readable output.
- Use `--output json` for explicit machine-readable output.
- Use `--paginate` on list commands to fetch all pages automatically.
- Use `--limit` and `--next` for manual pagination control.
- Prefer explicit flags and deterministic outputs in CI scripts.

## High-Signal Examples

```bash
# List apps
asc apps list --output table

# Upload a build
asc builds upload --app "123456789" --ipa "/path/to/MyApp.ipa"

# Validate and submit an App Store version
asc validate --app "123456789" --version "1.2.3"
